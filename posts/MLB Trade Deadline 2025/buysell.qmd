It might be hard to believe, but the MLB trade deadline is just over a week away.  We are fast approaching the single biggest tipping point in the regular season, the time when we see just how committed every team is to a World Series push.  All of the most recent champions have made additions at the trade deadline that led to contributions in October.  In 2021, the Atlanta Braves revamped their outfield by trading for Adam Duvall, Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario, and Jorge Soler.  Three months later, they hoisted the World Series trophy and Soler won WS MVP.  Those Braves are perhaps the best example of a championship team nailing the deadline, but the Texas Rangers' move for Jordan Montgomery and the Los Angeles Dodgers' deal for Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech shouldn't be ignored.  

Despite many preseason predictions that the Dodgers would enjoy historic success, there's no clear World Series favorite at the moment.  According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Dodgers still have the best odds, but the Milwaukee Brewers are the best team in baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros have the best records in the American League.  Only six teams in all of baseball are more than ten games out of a playoff spot, and with a recently expanded postseason format, the window to sneak into the playoffs is still ajar for many.  But just because it is possible to make a playoff push doesn't mean it's prudent.  In 2023, the Los Angeles Angels surged out of the All-Star break, going 11-5 and improving from one game under .500 to six games over.  With superstar Shohei Ohtani set to become a free agent at season's end, LA went all in.  The decision backfired miserably, as the Angels lost their next seven games and ended the season with a 73-89 record.  They could have traded Ohtani and recouped a huge return, but instead they gave away some of their top prospects for half a season of disappointment.  

I reference all these examples only to say that making the right choice at the deadline is paramount.  A mistake has the ability to set a franchise back for years, but the right moves have championship-winning potential.  Let's go across the league and discuss the best course of action for each ballclub.

**Arizona Diamondbacks: SELL**

The D-Backs are talented and trending in the right direction with Corbin Carroll, Ketel Marte, and Geraldo Perdomo.  But they've been very disappointing this year.  Pitching has been the issue, as only five team are allowing more runs per game than the Snakes.  If I am Arizona, I am setting 2027 as the year to go all in.  Pitchers Corbin Burnes and Justin Martinez will be out for most, if not all, of 2026, and many of their prospects are still developing.  With that in mind, pending free agents like Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Josh Naylor, and Eugenio Suarez need to go and should net a nice return.  I'd consider moving outfielder Randal Grichuk, too, even though he is under contract for another year.  If nothing else, Arizona needs to move Suarez and learn if top prospect Jordan Lawlar is ready for the show.

**Athletics: SELL**

This should be a pretty boring deadline for the A's.  They only have three upcoming free agents, and none will knock your socks off.  Miguel Andujar could be a useful piece for a contending team and should get dealt.  But the A's have no one to sell and no reason to buy.  Pitcher Luis Severino has been awful after signing a 3 year, $60 million contract, so perhaps the cost-conscious Athletics cut ties with him.  The 2025 season has been all about the young guys, and it's going to stay that way in Sacramento.

**Atlanta Braves: SELL**

To the surprise of many, the Braves are 14 games back in the NL East.  FanGraphs gives them a 1.5% chance of making the playoffs.  They've had some bad injury luck and should be back to contending next year.  Thus, only pending free agents should be dealt.  Raisel Iglesias, Rafael Montero, and Marcell Ozuna should bring back some decent returns. Atlanta only has one prospect in MLB's Top 100, so the farm system has plenty of room for improvement.

**Baltimore Orioles: SELL**

The Orioles have some really good pending free agents that need to go.  Seranthony Dominguez, Cedric Mullins, and All-Star Ryan O'Hearn are the best of the bunch.  The real question is to what extent will Baltimore sell.  Closer Felix Bautista, under team control for two more years, has been a topic of trade talks.  Barring a ridiculous return with MLB-ready, young pitching, Bautista should remain in Baltimore.  The O's window of contention is still open.  It's time for the front office to act like it and invest in starting pitching.  Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman will be looking for extensions soon, too.  If owner David Rubenstein is unwilling to open his pocketbook this offseason, they might as well trade Bautista now.

**Boston Red Sox: BUY**

I was originally in the "Sell" camp here, but I've changed my mind.  Boston currently sits in the final wild card spot, and I just don't see any teams waiting in the wings to take it away from them.  If they were to sell, closer Aroldis Chapman would fetch a pretty penny.  Jarren Duran could be moved as the odd man out in a loaded outfield.  I cannot, in good conscience, tell a team in a playoff position to offload assets.  However, the Sox should be careful.  Few teams have a future as bright as they do, with top prospects Roman Anthony, Kristian Campbell, and Marcelo Mayer poised to terrorize the AL East for at least the next five years.  I don't believe that Boston is good enough to win a championship right now, but it's likely that they will be in two years.  Craig Breslow and Co. have no reason to try and accelerate Boston's timeline at the risk of jeopardizing the future.  Go get a rental first baseman and some pitching help, but now is not the time for a big swing.

**Chicago Cubs: BUY**

There might never be a better time for the Cubs to go all in.  Superstar Kyle Tucker is a free agent after the season and will earn a massive contract.  Chicago would still be a good team without him, but right now they're downright scary.  To be a complete team, the Cubbies need better pitching.  Ryan Pressly lost his grip on the closer's role and the rotation has been beat up with injuries.  Starters Seth Lugo and Merrill Kelly are possibilities as rentals, and Sandy Alcantara and Edward Cabrera are more long-term options.

**Chicago White Sox: SELL**

No player is untouchable on these White Sox.  Any player who has entered the arbitration phase of his contract should be a trade candidate.  Luis Robert Jr. is the most interesting trade piece due to his athleticism, but his batting average has hovered around the Mendoza line all season.  The return would be lower than Chicago would like, but it would be worth it to at least get something.  

**Cincinnati Reds: SELL**

Reds fans won't like this, but Cincinnati is not good enough to win a World Series.  FanGraphs gives them an 11.1% chance of playing October baseball, and that's not enough to compromise a ripe farm system.  Nick Martinez and Emilio Pagan are both free agents after the season and could be shipped to a contender.  The Reds should focus on 2026, where they should have a great young rotation featuring Hunter Greene, Andrew Abbott, Nick Lodolo, Chase Burns, and Rhett Lowder.  Cincy could squeak into the playoffs this year but wouldn't make enough noise.

**Cleveland Guardians: SELL**

Cleveland is a .500 ballclub with all but three players under control until 2028.  Unlike previous years, they have shown no indication that they could compete in October.  They rank in the bottom five in baseball in runs, hits, batting average, OBP, SLG, and OPS.  They sport a negative run differential, and their pitching has been average.  And yet, they are only three games out of a playoff spot.  Carlos Santana's contract expires after the season, so he could be a trade piece.  The Guardians are in that middle ground where they aren't bad enough to throw in the towel but they aren't good enough to buy.  In those instances, I always lean towards selling.  Closer Emmanuel Clase should only be traded for a monumental return.

**Colorado Rockies: SELL**

Oh, dear.  Honestly, it's hard to imagine any team coveting a Rockies player outside of Brenton Doyle, Hunter Goodman, and Ezequiel Tovar.  Maybe a reliever like Jake Bird could make an impact somewhere.  Ryan McMahon is in the midst of a rough year, but he could be an option for a team with a hole at the hot corner.  Colorado is so far from contention that if they get a deal they like for any player, they should take it.  No Rockie is untouchable.

**Detroit Tigers: BUY**

Although they've struggled as of late, Detroit is a pretty complete team.  Tarik Skubal can win them 2 games in a 5-game series at his best.  The rest of the rotation is fine, but it wouldn't hurt to add someone like Alcantara or Zac Gallen.  The Tigers would do well to bolster their bullpen, too.  David Bednar or Pete Fairbanks would be nice options.  Detroit has spent much of the year as the best team in the AL; it's time for them to use the deadline to reclaim that spot.

**Houston Astros: BUY**

Every time we have reason to doubt the Astros, they prove us wrong.  After losing Alex Bregman and Tucker, it seemed like the franchise might be in a transition period.  Instead, Hunter Brown has emerged as an ace alongside Framber Valdez and the offense hasn't missed a beat.  The 'pen is loaded in Houston, so the Astros should scour the market for a left-handed hitter.  Cedric Mullins could be a helpful addition, and McMahon could fill a gap at the hot corner after Isaac Paredes' injury.

**Kansas City Royals: BUY**

After a fun postseason run last year, the Royals are three games under .500 and have a 10.8% chance at the playoffs.  However, KC has no notable upcoming free agents.  The options are to be aggressive sellers and move guys under contract for 2026 or to buy with the future in mind.  I'm taking the latter.  The Royals don't have any prospects knocking at the door, so any help next year will come externally.  For that reason, why not just make some additions now and see if some magic happens in September?  The outfield has been a major issue, I wouldn't mind seeing the Royals swing a deal for Adolis Garcia or Bryan Reynolds.  Both are buy-low candidates but have enjoyed success before.

**Los Angeles Angels: SELL**

The Angels seem incapable of rebuilding properly.  Here's their chance.  They have a host of expiring contracts, Tyler Anderson, Kenley Jansen, and Luis Rengifo among them.  All could fetch a modest return.  It would be the most "Angels" thing ever to win five or six in a row, start buying, and then rush prospects to the big leagues in hopes of a postseason run.  Please, please just concede this season.  

**Los Angeles Dodgers: BUY**

LA has been hit hard by injuries and hasn't been the juggernaut many expected.  The bullpen is the biggest weak spot, especially after an injury to closer Tanner Scott.  Without too much pitching help coming from the minors, expect the Dodgers to be in on all the big names in the bullpen this week.  If the Athletics are listening on Mason Miller, the Dodgers could be a nice fit.

**Miami Marlins: SELL**

Like Colorado, Miami is far enough from contention that most players should be on the table.  But unlike the Rockies, the Fish have some pieces.  Sandy Alcantara might be the most coveted starter available thanks to his contract and his Cy Young pedigree.  Righty Edward Cabrera has also generated some buzz, but he is under team control until 2029.  Miami should move Alcantara but hold on to Cabrera barring a ridiculous offer.  Outfielder Jesus Sanchez should be traded as well.  Houston or Kansas City could be good spots.  

**Milwaukee Brewers: BUY**

Milwaukee has been on fire recently, rattling off ten consecutive wins to take control of the NL Central.  The starting rotation and bullpen have been quietly excellent, but an additional relief arm wouldn't hurt.  The bigger issue lies at shortstop, where Joey Ortiz has struggled to fill Willy Adames' shoes.  The deadline options in the middle infield are pretty light, but the Twins' Willi Castro and the Pirates' Isiah Kiner-Falefa are possibilities.  Milwaukee could also seek a reunion with Colorado's Orlando Arcia.

**Minnesota Twins: SELL**

The Twins are pretty much in the same position as the Royals, with one major difference: they have significant upcoming free agents to sell.  The aforementioned Castro could fill a hole on any contender due to his versatility, and catcher Christian Vazquez is a two-time champion behind the dish.  Southpaw Danny Coulombe has been excellent in the bullpen and should be moved.  Minnesota's bigger fish, Jhoan Duran and Joe Ryan, are under contract for at least two more years.  I see no reason to trade them and risk being noncompetitive in those seasons.

**New York Mets: BUY**

The Mets' starting rotation has been hit hard by injuries, so restoring it needs to be priorities one, two, and three.  David Stearns and the front office could turn to familiar faces to fill those gaps.  Lugo and Severino are both former Mets and could play a role in another deep postseason run.  The other starting pitching options like Kelly and Gallen would also make sense.

**New York Yankees: BUY**

It seems like everything is falling apart in the Bronx, but the Yankees are still given a 89.2% chance of making the postseason.  They have a gaping hole at 3rd base, and the Diamondbacks' Suarez could be the best player available at the deadline.  Some worry that Suarez has too much swing-and-miss in his game for a Yankees team that strikes out a lot, but the prospects of Suarez's power in Yankee Stadium is tantalizing.  Other options at third base are McMahon, St. Louis' Nolan Arenado, and Pittsburgh's Ke'Bryan Hayes.  New York also needs a starting pitcher.  It will be interesting to see how aggressive GM Brian Cashman is.

**Philadelphia Phillies: BUY**

The Phillies are incredibly top-heavy.  Stars Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and Bryce Harper have carried the load offensively while the rest of the offense has struggled.  Same goes for the pitching, where the brilliance of a dominant rotation has hidden some issues in a terrible bullpen.  The Phils are in the market for a right-handed hitting outfielder and relief help.  Orioles outfielder Ramon Laureano could be an option, and Philadelphia has been connected to all the big-name closers.  GM "Dealin' Dave" Dombrowski should hold on to top prospects Andrew Painter and Aidan Miller but should not hesitate to move starter Mick Abel for the right price.

**Pittsburgh Pirates: SELL**

Another disappointing year in Pittsburgh means it's time to sell again.  First, let's make this clear: Paul Skenes is going nowhere.  There are some pieces with potential, though.  Andrew Heaney could be a good option for a playoff push, and Kiner-Falefa might just be the best shortstop available.  The Bucs would do well to capitalize on closer David Bednar's resurgence.  He's been fantastic since returning from Triple A, but who knows when he'll revert back to the performance that earned him a demotion in the first place. 

**San Diego Padres: BUY**

Left field and catcher are the biggest areas of need for a Padres team that has failed to get over the hump in October.  San Diego could try swinging a big trade for Jarren Duran, but I think a smaller trade for Mike Tauchman of the White Sox or Taylor Ward of the Angels might make more sense.  Bringing on the leadership and defense of Vazquez behind the plate could help this team win when it matters.

**San Francisco Giants: BUY**

San Fran made the biggest splash of the season already, trading for disgruntled Boston star Rafael Devers.  They are working him in at first base, which is one of their most sizable holes.  Now, it's time to fix the starting rotation.  Logan Webb and Robbie Ray have been great, but Hayden Birdsong was demoted and Justin Verlander just won his *first* game all year.  Giants fans would appreciate the addition of a starter like Lugo or Gallen.  With Devers hopefully vacating the DH spot, acquiring Ozuna or O'Hearn could make sense.

**Seattle Mariners: BUY**

Per usual, Seattle's starting pitching has excelled, but the offense could be better.  There's a huge hole at first base, and the team needs to do more to support Cal Raleigh.  I'd love to see Suarez return to Seattle to add more pop to that lineup.  Rookie Ben Williamson has played a nice third base, but he doesn't offer the offensive upside that Suarez brings.  

*Note: While I was writing this, Seattle acquired 1B Naylor from Arizona for two prospects.  Great move for them.*

**St. Louis Cardinals: SELL**

Again, I hate telling a team over .500 to sell, but the Cardinals have to do it.  Closer Ryan Helsley is the reason why.  He's a free agent after the season and could be the best arm moved at the deadline.  Veteran starters Erick Fedde and Miles Mikolas could be dealt as well.  If St. Louis can find a trade partner for the aging Nolan Arenado, they should jump at that chance, too.  

**Tampa Bay Rays: BUY**

With a 29.6% chance of playing in October, it might seem ambitious for Tampa Bay to buy.  But with only one pending free agent, the Rays can run back a similar team next year and compete.  They've had some tough injury luck this year with Shane McClanahan and Ha-Seong Kim.  Buying with an eye towards 2026 would be in their best interest.  If the White Sox were willing to eat some money, I could see the Rays having success buying low on Robert Jr.

**Texas Rangers: BUY**

This could really go either way.  Texas is only a game and a half out of a wild card spot, and they have a better chance to make the postseason than Tampa Bay.  But they are an older team with more obvious trade candidates.  There might be no better time to move on from Jacob deGrom, who once again looks like an ace.  But since the Rangers don't stand to lose any significant free agents this offseason, I would once again buy with an eye towards the future.  If things break right for Texas, they could sneak into the playoffs and make some noise.  Remember, this team is only two years removed from winnning the World Series.  

**Toronto Blue Jays: BUY**

The Jays have defied all expectations and sit in first place in the AL East.  Their Pythagorean record (based on run differential) is a little less optimistic, so Toronto has work to do at the deadline.  Like most teams, they will be eyeing pitching as August 1 approaches.  An additional outfielder like Adolis Garcia might also make sense to add extra thump to the lineup.

**Washington Nationals: SELL**

This hasn't been the season that Washington has hoped for.  GM Mike Rizzo and manager Dave Martinez were both cut loose after failing to unlock a young roster that has legitimate talent.  It feels like we see this every year, but Kyle Finnegan and Josh Bell should be dealt without question.  Perhaps Michael Soroka is traded as well as he attempts to bounce back from a litany of injuries.  The last two months for the Nats should be all about the young guys.  Prospects Robert Hassell III and Brady House should be given plenty of playing time.
