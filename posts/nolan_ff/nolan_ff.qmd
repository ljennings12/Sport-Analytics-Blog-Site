I love fantasy football.  I can remember my first year playing with my friends, when we all drafted quarterbacks first and half the league was controlled by overqualified dads (we were third graders). Since then, the seasons have been filled with highs and lows.  I love reminding my friends how I hit on Patrick Mahomes during his breakout year, and they're always quick to fire back with the year I guaranteed a Kelvin Benjamin breakout.  But no matter the year or my success in the previous season, I always construct my own rankings.  I do my fair share of research, but they're essentially from scratch.  I jot them down in a little black notebook that has become a mainstay in the draft room.  I may not be the greatest fantasy manager, but I like to think I've learned enough through the years to make my opinion worth something.  Regardless or whether you agree or not, here are my rankings for the 2025 season.  

*Created with non-PPR leagues in mind.*

**QB**

1. Josh Allen, BUF

2. Jalen Hurts, PHI

3. Lamar Jackson, BAL

4. Jayden Daniels, WAS

5. Joe Burrow, CIN

6. Baker Mayfield, TB

7. C.J. Stroud, HOU

8. Patrick Mahomes, KC

9. Justin Fields, NYJ

10. Caleb Williams, CHI

11. Kyler Murray, ARI

12. Jordan Love, GB

13. Dak Prescott, DAL

14. Bo Nix, DEN

15. Drake Maye, NE

16. Trevor Lawrence, JAX

17. Justin Herbert, LAC

18. Michael Penix Jr, ATL

19. Brock Purdy, SF

20. J.J. McCarthy, MIN

*Undervalued: C.J. Stroud*

The fantasy community has really soured on Stroud after a down sophomore campaign.  He often tried to do too much last year, and that led to a dismal 12 interceptions.  But his rookie season was phenomenal, and Houston bolstered its receiving core in the draft.  Look for Stroud to bounce back in a big way under new OC Nick Caley.  You won't need to take Stroud this high to land him in drafts.

*Overvalued: Brock Purdy*

Purdy could definitely be a servicable starter this year for your fantasy team.  That said, the weapons have gotten much worse in San Fran.  Deebo Samuel is gone, and Brandon Aiyuk will miss the start of the season with an ACL injury.  Jauan Jennings is also dinged up, leaving Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle as the only healthy options.  If Christian McCaffrey is at full strength, the offense will run through him, not Purdy.  Pass on Purdy and take a shot on someone with higher upside.

**RB**

1. Saquon Barkley, PHI

2. Bijan Robinson, ATL

3. Jahmyr Gibbs, DET

4. Christian McCaffrey, SF

5. Ashton Jeanty, LV

6. Derrick Henry, BAL

7. Jonathan Taylor, IND

8. De'Von Achane, MIA

9. Josh Jacobs, GB

10. Chase Brown, CIN

11. Kenneth Walker, SEA

12. Bucky Irving, TB

13. Kyren Williams, LAR

14. James Cook, BUF

15. Omarion Hampton, LAC

16. James Conner, ARI

17. Isiah Pacheco, KC

18. Breece Hall, NYJ

19. Tony Pollard, TEN

20. TreVeyon Henderson, NE

21. Chuba Hubbard, CAR

22. Alvin Kamara, NO

23. Aaron Jones, MIN

24. David Montgomery, DET

25. J.K. Dobbins, DEN

26. D'Andre Swift, CHI

27. Tyrone Tracy, NYG

28. Jaylen Warren, PIT

29. Tank Bigsby, JAX

30. R.J. Harvey, DEN

31. Kaleb Johnson, PIT

32. Jordan Mason, MIN

33. Joe Mixon, HOU

34. Jacory Croskey-Merritt, WAS

35. Quinshon Judkins, CLE

36. Zach Charbonnet, SEA

37. Travis Etienne, JAX

38. Javonte Williams, DAL

39. Nick Chubb, HOU

40. Jaydon Blue, DAL

41. Austin Ekeler, WAS

42. Braelon Allen, NYJ

43. Rhamondre Stevenson, NE

44. Bhayshul Tuten, JAX

45. Brian Robinson, SF

46. Tyjae Spears, TEN

47. Trey Benson, ARI

48. Ray Davis, BUF

49. Jerome Ford, CLE

50. Rico Dowdle, CAR


*Undervalued: Isiah Pacheco*

Like Stroud, we seem to have forgotten about Pacheco at his best.  He is fully healthy and has little competition in the backfield.  More importantly, he is tied to the Kansas City Chiefs offense.  There will be lots of scoring and even more positive game scripts.  Pacheco could be a steal for your fantasy team this year.

*Overvalued: David Montgomery*

I don't feel super strongly about this one, but just buy Montgomery with caution.  Jahmyr Gibbs is only getting better, and Monty could soon be relegated to the No. 2 instead of the 1A.  Former OC Ben Johnson is in Chicago, and the Lions will be hard-pressed to score as much as they did last season.  If you believe in Gibbs, don't waste a pick on Montgomery.

**WR**

1. Ja'Marr Chase, CIN

2. CeeDee Lamb, DAL

3. Justin Jefferson, MIN

4. Malik Nabers, NYG

5. Nico Collins, HOU

6. Amon-Ra St. Brown, DET

7. Brian Thomas Jr, JAX

8. Puka Nacua, LAR

9. Drake London, ATL

10. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, SEA

11. A.J. Brown, PHI

12. Marvin Harrison Jr, ARI

13. Ladd McConkey, LAC

14. Tyreek Hill, MIA

15. Tee Higgins, CIN

16. Mike Evans, TB

17. Terry McLaurin, WAS

18. Garrett Wilson, NYJ

19. Tetairoa McMillan, CAR

20. D.K. Metcalf, PIT

21. Davante Adams, LAR

22. D.J. Moore, CHI

23. George Pickens, DAL

24. Devonta Smith, PHI

25. Zay Flowers, BAL

26. Xavier Worthy, KC

27. Rashee Rice, KC

28. Jaylen Waddle, MIA

29. Jordan Addison, MIN

30. Courtland Sutton, DEN

31. Emeka Egbuka, TB

32. Travis Hunter, JAX

33. Jameson Williams, DET

34. Calvin Ridley, TEN

35. Jayden Reed, GB

36. Chris Olave, NO

37. Deebo Samuel, WAS

38. Rome Odunze, CHI

39. Ricky Pearsall, SF

40. Stefon Diggs, NE

41. Jakobi Meyers, LV

42. Matthew Golden, GB

43. Christian Kirk, HOU

44. Josh Downs, IND

45. Jauan Jennings, SF

46. Cooper Kupp, SEA

47. Jerry Jeudy, CLE

48. Keon Coleman, BUF

49. Michael Pittman Jr, IND

50. Rashod Bateman, BAL

*Undervalued: Marvin Harrison, Jr.*

His rookie season wasn't bad, but it's safe to say Harrison was a disappointment in fantasy last year.  The fact that his 2024 Draft classmates overshadowed him might allow you to nab MHJ at a discount this year.  He and TE Trey McBride are the two true receiving weapons in Arizona, so targets won't be an issue.  Expect Harrison to deliver on the hype that surrounded him coming out of Ohio State.

*Overvalued: Puka Nacua*

Nacua is a great receiver, and this dubious distinction has nothing to do with him.  Rams QB Matthew Stafford has been fighting through back problems all offseason.  If Stafford misses time, Nacua's season could be derailed.  I don't want to draft someone whose success hinges on the health of a 37-year old signal caller who has taken his share of hits throughout the years.

**TE**

1. Brock Bowers, LV

2. Trey McBride, ARI

3. George Kittle, SF

4. Sam LaPorta, DET

5. T.J. Hockenson, MIN

6. Travis Kelce, KC

7. Mark Andrews, BAL

8. Evan Engram, DEN

9. Kyle Pitts, ATL

10. Tucker Kraft, GB

11. Tyler Warren, IND

12. Dalton Kincaid, BUF

13. David Njoku, CLE

14. Jonnu Smith, PIT

15. Jake Ferguson, DAL

16. Hunter Henry, NE

17. Dallas Goedert, PHI

18. Colston Loveland, CHI

19. Brenton Strange, JAX

20. Zach Ertz, WAS

*Undervalued: Tyler Warren*

Could Warren be the next rookie tight end to break out?  I think so.  Warren was dynamic at Penn State, and Indianapolis should do whatever it can to get the ball into his hands.  An uncertain QB situation might actually help Warren reel in additional checkdown targets.  Gambling on a rookie TE can be risky, but Warren combines talent with opportunity in Indy.  

*Overvalued: David Njoku*

Njoku has proven to be a valuable fantasy asset, but don't pay up for him this year.  Cleveland is going to be abysmal, and I don't want any part of that offense on my fantasy team.  The best-case scenario for the veteran might be a midseason trade.  Go invest in a tight end with more upside.
