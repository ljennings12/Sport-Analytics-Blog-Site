    "text": "If you’re like me, you use any excuse possible to think about baseball. So when the ballot was released for the 2025 All-Star Game, I found myself voting every day, five times a day. Some votes were easy, like Cal Raleigh as AL catcher or Aaron Judge in the AL outfield. I sprinkled in some hometown bias, selecting Phillies Trea Turner and Kyle Schwarber (yes, over Ohtani, I’m sorry). But over the weeks of voting, I rarely submitted the same ballot from day to day, and the cause for that was the outfield. Since there are more spots available (3) and options to choose from, there weren’t the same clear-cut favorites that dominated other positions. The NL was especially tough, with seven or eight players warranting my consideration. Many of these guys had similar stats, so I racked my brain for a way to distinguish the top three.\nLet’s switch our focus for a second. Raise your hand if you’ve seen an NFL game where a team is down big in the 4th quarter. Suddenly, they’re unstoppable for some reason, with a quarterback that looks like Tom Brady and a wide receiver that has turned from Clark Kent into Superman. You wonder, “Where has this been all game?” You can put your hand down now. These moments in games where the outcome is all but decided are called garbage time. It may be your first instinct to stop watching and do something else with your time once a contest has entered this phase, and I don’t blame you. But be wary. Stats in garbage time count just the same as the rest. In football, it can be very easy to identify the “empty stat”, where yards are accumulated that have no impact on the game’s result. There are only seventeen games, so the blowouts stick out in our minds. In basketball, we might dismiss the performance of the best player on a bad team because “someone has to take the shots”. But we often forget that garbage time in baseball is a real thing, too. Low-leverage situations mean lower-caliber pitching, making it easier for hitters to reach base and improve their stats. If a batter hits a home run every time he is in the midst of a blowout, his numbers look juicy, but he isn’t really making all that much of an impact. So getting back to the All-Star voting, I wanted to apply this concept. All the hitters in question are having fantastic seasons, but who is doing it when it really matters? That’s someone I’d like to see in the Midsummer Classic.\nNow, let’s talk numbers. Win Probability Added (WPA) is a good place to start for quantifying a player’s effect on winning games. I will explain it using an example. At a given point in a game, the Yankees have a 40% chance of winning. Babe Ruth steps up to the plate and wallops a home run. New York’s chances of victory rise to 70%. For that plate appearance, Ruth has a WPA of 0.3, which is the change in the Yankees’ chances of winning (0.7-0.4). Say instead of going yard, Ruth strikes out, and the Yankees’ chances of winning drop to 30%. His WPA for that at-bat is -0.1. Every plate appearance comes with a WPA, and it is dependent on both the situation and the outcome. A home run in a tie game in the ninth inning will come with a much greater WPA than one during a blowout in the sixth. WPA is additive and accumulated over the course of a season.\nAs I said before, WPA is a product of situation and outcome. However, players can only control the latter. Since our goal is to compare players to others, we need to account for the fact that all players are thrust into different situations. Perhaps Player A has a higher WPA than Player B, but that might only be because Player A has had more at bats in high-leverage spots. To even the playing field, we can use Context Neutral Wins. To calculate Context Neutral Wins, WPA is divided by the Leverage Index (LI) of a plate appearance. I won’t go into too much detail, but LI essentially quantifies the importance of a situation during a game. For more info, check out this FanGraphs explanation. Context Neutral Wins allows us to compare players’ performance based on WPA in an apples-to-apples way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above chart Context Neutral Wins against wRC+, a useful one-number summary for offensive output, and WAR, a measurement of overall performance, defense included. Both plots show a positive correlation, but the correlation between wRC+ and Context Neutral Wins is slightly stronger (about 0.9 vs.0.8). This makes sense, as both metrics are limited to offensive performance. Highlighted in blue are the subjects of my NL outfield conundrum, and the plots can help me to make an informed decision. I’m a fan of WAR, so Pete Crow-Armstrong is an obvious choice. After that, things get murkier. Corbin Carroll, Fernando Tatis, Kyle Tucker, and James Wood are all in the 3.7 to 4 WAR range. I could flip a coin, or I could turn to Context Neutral Wins and see that Wood and Tucker have a slight edge over Tatis and a sizable one over Carroll. If you love offense, you might vote for Juan Soto, who shines in wRC+ and Context Neutral Wins but whose WAR is held back by defensive limitations.\nAs a fan, it’s up to you how heavily you want to weigh Context Neutral Wins. Personally, I like the idea of a statistic rooted in WPA. I can easily see how much a given at-bat changes the likelihood of a win or a loss and attribute that change to a player. Is it more complete than WAR or more intuitive than OPS? Probably not. But it’s a way to evaluate players outside those mainstream metrics, and thus could result in a competitive advantage in the batter’s box.\nAuthor’s note: statistics through July 11, after the All-Star teams were announced. The NL outfield starters are Ronald Acuna, Crow-Armstrong, and Tucker. Carroll, Kyle Stowers, Tatis, and Wood are the reserves."

    "title": "2025 NBA Mock Draft",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2025 NBA Draft is upon us, and executives around the league have already kicked into high gear. Impact players like Desmond Bane, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis have already been traded, and the wheeling and dealing is certain to continue throughout the draft, which now spans two days. This year’s draft features a generational prospect, loaded rosters with unusually high selections, and a team with five (5!) first-round choices. Let’s take a look at how the first round might play out.\n1. Dallas Mavericks: F Cooper Flagg, Duke\n2. San Antonio Spurs: G Dylan Harper, Rutgers\n3. Philadelphia 76ers: G VJ Edgecombe, Baylor\n4. Charlotte Hornets: F Ace Bailey, Rutgers\n5. Utah Jazz: G Tre Johnson, Texas\nFlagg and Harper seem like locks to go 1 and 2, but it gets interesting when the 76ers pick. Ace Bailey, probably presumed to go third based on sheer talent, hasn’t worked out for any teams and actually canceled his workout for Philadelphia. His tumultuous pre-draft process clashes with Edgecombe’s, as teams love the Baylor guard’s motor and makeup. The Sixers, who have had their share of first-round flameouts (see Simmons, Ben or Fultz, Markelle), take the safe route and opt for the bouncy Bahamian. Charlotte snaps up Bailey with the fourth pick, as he will have an opportunity to contribute immediately alongside LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Johnson has the potential to develop into an elite scorer. He averaged 19.9 points per game as a freshamn in the SEC and pairs a 6’5’’ frame with a 40% 3-point percentage.\n6. Washington Wizards: G Jeremiah Fears, Oklahoma\n7. New Orleans Pelicans: C Khaman Maluach, Duke\n8. Brooklyn Nets: G Kon Knueppel, Duke\n9. Toronto Raptors: G Kasparas Jakucionis, Illinois\n10. Phoenix Suns: C Derik Queen, Maryland\nWith Maluach and Knueppel going 7th and 8th, the lottery is heavy on Blue Devils. Both are safer picks who flourished in their roles at Duke but likely won’t grow into superstars like the top picks could. Fears is on the smaller side (6’2’’), but he is dynamic with the ball in his hands and displayed a knack for clutch buckets at Oklahoma. While they play different positions, Jakucionis and Queen are deft facilitators and would be welcome additions for teams at the back end of the lottery.\n11. Portland Trail Blazers: F Noa Essengue, Ratiopharm Ulm\n12. Chicago Bulls: F Collin Murray-Boyles, South Carolina\n13. Atlanta Hawks: F Carter Bryant, Arizona\n14. San Antonio Spurs: G Egor Demin, BYU\n15. Oklahoma City Thunder: C Joan Beringer, KK Cedevita Olimpija\nOutside of Murray-Boyles, these picks are projects. All are either 18 or 19 years old, and none averaged over 11 points last season. Demin is a supersized 6’8’’ PG, but he only knocked down 27.3% of his threes at BYU. Essengue also struggled from beyond the arc, but he brings size and defense to Portland. Bryant only averaged 6.5 points per game with the Wildcats, though the Hawks may see him as a DeAndre Hunter facsimile. The NBA champs are loaded and have no real weaknesses, so they take a flier on the ultimate project in Beringer. The Frenchman averaged less than 6 PPG in Slovenia. His 7-foot frame comes with remarkable upside.\n16. Memphis Grizzlies: F Cedric Coward, Washington St.\n17. Minnesota Timberwwolves: F Asa Newell, Georgia\n18. Washington Wizards: C Thomas Sorber, Georgetown\n19. Brooklyn Nets: C Danny Wolf, Michigan\n20. Miami Heat: G Walter Clayton Jr, Florida\nYou might remember Clayton from the NCAA Tournament, as his unconscious shooting led the Gators to a National Championship. His age is working against him, but Clayton has the tools to help a team win right away. Wolf was another fixture in March who pairs the body of a center with the playmaking ability of a guard. In a season hindered by injury, Sorber averaged 14.5 PPG and 8.5 RPG as a Hoya. He and Fears would be solid building blocks for a Wizards team that has been treading water for too long.\n21. Utah Jazz: F Hugo Gonzalez, Real Madrid\n22. Brooklyn Nets: G Nolan Traore, Saint-Quentin\n23. New Orleans Pelicans: F Liam NcNeeley, Uconn\n24. Oklahoma City Thunder: F Noah Penda, Le Mans Sarthe\n25. Orlando Magic: F Rasheer Fleming, St. Joseph’s\nThe Thunder double down on Frenchmen and take Penda at pick 24. It wouldn’t be surprising to see GM Sam Presti move this pick for future assets. Gonzalez and Traore are both 19 years of age and will need time to develop. Utah and Brooklyn are years away from making noise and can give them plenty of playing time. McNeeley, who was teammates with Flagg, Queen, and Newell in high school, can do everything well but lacks a calling card.\n26. Brooklyn Nets: F Will Riley, Illinois\n27. Brooklyn Nets: F Drake Powell, North Carolina\n28. Boston Celtics: G Nique Clifford, Colorado St.\n29. Phoenix Suns: C Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton\n30. Los Angeles Clippers: F Johni Broome, Auburn\nIf it seems like you’ve been seeing a lot of Nets mentions, it’s because you have. Brooklyn has a staggering five first-round picks, and it would be shocking if none were dealt. The last picks of the round don’t lack for experience. Clifford, Kalkbrenner, and Broome are all 23 and could join an NBA rotation from the get-go. With the injury to Jayson Tatum and trades of Holiday and Porzingis, Boston is in a bridge year and may ask for immediate contributions from Clifford. The Suns are preparing for life without Kevin Durant and currently roster a guard-heavy team. Kalkbrenner provides a serious lob threat and stifling rim protector."
