    "text": "If you’re like me, you use any excuse possible to think about baseball. So when the ballot was released for the 2025 All-Star Game, I found myself voting every day, five times a day. Some votes were easy, like Cal Raleigh as AL catcher or Aaron Judge in the AL outfield. I sprinkled in some hometown bias, selecting Phillies Trea Turner and Kyle Schwarber (yes, over Ohtani, I’m sorry). But over the weeks of voting, I rarely submitted the same ballot from day to day, and the cause for that was the outfield. Since there are more spots available (3) and options to choose from, there weren’t the same clear-cut favorites that dominated other positions. The NL was especially tough, with seven or eight players warranting my consideration. Many of these guys had similar stats, so I racked my brain for a way to distinguish the top three.\nLet’s switch our focus for a second. Raise your hand if you’ve seen an NFL game where a team is down big in the 4th quarter. Suddenly, they’re unstoppable for some reason, with a quarterback that looks like Tom Brady and a wide receiver that has turned from Clark Kent into Superman. You wonder, “Where has this been all game?” You can put your hand down now. These moments in games where the outcome is all but decided are called garbage time. It may be your first instinct to stop watching and do something else with your time once a contest has entered this phase, and I don’t blame you. But be wary. Stats in garbage time count just the same as the rest. In football, it can be very easy to identify the “empty stat”, where yards are accumulated that have no impact on the game’s result. There are only seventeen games, so the blowouts stick out in our minds. In basketball, we might dismiss the performance of the best player on a bad team because “someone has to take the shots”. But we often forget that garbage time in baseball is a real thing, too. Low-leverage situations mean lower-caliber pitching, making it easier for hitters to reach base and improve their stats. If a batter hits a home run every time he is in the midst of a blowout, his numbers look juicy, but he isn’t really making all that much of an impact. So getting back to the All-Star voting, I wanted to apply this concept. All the hitters in question are having fantastic seasons, but who is doing it when it really matters? That’s someone I’d like to see in the Midsummer Classic.\nNow, let’s talk numbers. Win Probability Added (WPA) is a good place to start for quantifying a player’s effect on winning games. I will explain it using an example. At a given point in a game, the Yankees have a 40% chance of winning. Babe Ruth steps up to the plate and wallops a home run. New York’s chances of victory rise to 70%. For that plate appearance, Ruth has a WPA of 0.3, which is the change in the Yankees’ chances of winning (0.7-0.4). Say instead of going yard, Ruth strikes out, and the Yankees’ chances of winning drop to 30%. His WPA for that at-bat is -0.1. Every plate appearance comes with a WPA, and it is dependent on both the situation and the outcome. A home run in a tie game in the ninth inning will come with a much greater WPA than one during a blowout in the sixth. WPA is additive and accumulated over the course of a season.\nAs I said before, WPA is a product of situation and outcome. However, players can only control the latter. Since our goal is to compare players to others, we need to account for the fact that all players are thrust into different situations. Perhaps Player A has a higher WPA than Player B, but that might only be because Player A has had more at bats in high-leverage spots. To even the playing field, we can use Context Neutral Wins. To calculate Context Neutral Wins, WPA is divided by the Leverage Index (LI) of a plate appearance. I won’t go into too much detail, but LI essentially quantifies the importance of a situation during a game. For more info, check out this FanGraphs explanation. Context Neutral Wins allows us to compare players’ performance based on WPA in an apples-to-apples way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots above chart Context Neutral Wins against wRC+, a useful one-number summary for offensive output, and WAR, a measurement of overall performance, defense included. Both plots show a positive correlation, but the correlation between wRC+ and Context Neutral Wins is slightly stronger (about 0.9 vs.0.8). This makes sense, as both metrics are limited to offensive performance. Highlighted in blue are the subjects of my NL outfield conundrum, and the plots can help me to make an informed decision. I’m a fan of WAR, so Pete Crow-Armstrong is an obvious choice. After that, things get murkier. Corbin Carroll, Fernando Tatis, Kyle Tucker, and James Wood are all in the 3.7 to 4 WAR range. I could flip a coin, or I could turn to Context Neutral Wins and see that Wood and Tucker have a slight edge over Tatis and a sizable one over Carroll. If you love offense, you might vote for Juan Soto, who shines in wRC+ and Context Neutral Wins but whose WAR is held back by defensive limitations.\nAs a fan, it’s up to you how heavily you want to weigh Context Neutral Wins. Personally, I like the idea of a statistic rooted in WPA. I can easily see how much a given at-bat changes the likelihood of a win or a loss and attribute that change to a player. Is it more complete than WAR or more intuitive than OPS? Probably not. But it’s a way to evaluate players outside those mainstream metrics, and thus could result in a competitive advantage in the batter’s box.\nAuthor’s note: statistics through July 11, after the All-Star teams were announced. The NL outfield starters are Ronald Acuna, Crow-Armstrong, and Tucker. Carroll, Kyle Stowers, Tatis, and Wood are the reserves."

    "title": "Buyers and Sellers at the MLB Trade Deadline",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It might be hard to believe, but the MLB trade deadline is just over a week away. We are fast approaching the single biggest tipping point in the regular season, the time when we see just how committed every team is to a World Series push. All of the most recent champions have made additions at the trade deadline that led to contributions in October. In 2021, the Atlanta Braves revamped their outfield by trading for Adam Duvall, Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario, and Jorge Soler. Three months later, they hoisted the World Series trophy and Soler won WS MVP. Those Braves are perhaps the best example of a championship team nailing the deadline, but the Texas Rangers’ move for Jordan Montgomery and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ deal for Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech shouldn’t be ignored.\nDespite many preseason predictions that the Dodgers would enjoy historic success, there’s no clear World Series favorite at the moment. According to FanDuel Sportsbook, the Dodgers still have the best odds, but the Milwaukee Brewers are the best team in baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros have the best records in the American League. Only six teams in all of baseball are more than ten games out of a playoff spot, and with a recently expanded postseason format, the window to sneak into the playoffs is still ajar for many. But just because it is possible to make a playoff push doesn’t mean it’s prudent. In 2023, the Los Angeles Angels surged out of the All-Star break, going 11-5 and improving from one game under .500 to six games over. With superstar Shohei Ohtani set to become a free agent at season’s end, LA went all in. The decision backfired miserably, as the Angels lost their next seven games and ended the season with a 73-89 record. They could have traded Ohtani and recouped a huge return, but instead they gave away some of their top prospects for half a season of disappointment.\nI reference all these examples only to say that making the right choice at the deadline is paramount. A mistake has the ability to set a franchise back for years, but the right moves have championship-winning potential. Let’s go across the league and discuss the best course of action for each ballclub.\nArizona Diamondbacks: SELL\nThe D-Backs are talented and trending in the right direction with Corbin Carroll, Ketel Marte, and Geraldo Perdomo. But they’ve been very disappointing this year. Pitching has been the issue, as only five team are allowing more runs per game than the Snakes. If I am Arizona, I am setting 2027 as the year to go all in. Pitchers Corbin Burnes and Justin Martinez will be out for most, if not all, of 2026, and many of their prospects are still developing. With that in mind, pending free agents like Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, Josh Naylor, and Eugenio Suarez need to go and should net a nice return. I’d consider moving outfielder Randal Grichuk, too, even though he is under contract for another year. If nothing else, Arizona needs to move Suarez and learn if top prospect Jordan Lawlar is ready for the show.\nAthletics: SELL\nThis should be a pretty boring deadline for the A’s. They only have three upcoming free agents, and none will knock your socks off. Miguel Andujar could be a useful piece for a contending team and should get dealt. But the A’s have no one to sell and no reason to buy. Pitcher Luis Severino has been awful after signing a 3 year, $60 million contract, so perhaps the cost-conscious Athletics cut ties with him. The 2025 season has been all about the young guys, and it’s going to stay that way in Sacramento.\nAtlanta Braves: SELL\nTo the surprise of many, the Braves are 14 games back in the NL East. FanGraphs gives them a 1.5% chance of making the playoffs. They’ve had some bad injury luck and should be back to contending next year. Thus, only pending free agents should be dealt. Raisel Iglesias, Rafael Montero, and Marcell Ozuna should bring back some decent returns. Atlanta only has one prospect in MLB’s Top 100, so the farm system has plenty of room for improvement.\nBaltimore Orioles: SELL\nThe Orioles have some really good pending free agents that need to go. Seranthony Dominguez, Cedric Mullins, and All-Star Ryan O’Hearn are the best of the bunch. The real question is to what extent will Baltimore sell. Closer Felix Bautista, under team control for two more years, has been a topic of trade talks. Barring a ridiculous return with MLB-ready, young pitching, Bautista should remain in Baltimore. The O’s window of contention is still open. It’s time for the front office to act like it and invest in starting pitching. Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman will be looking for extensions soon, too. If owner David Rubenstein is unwilling to open his pocketbook this offseason, they might as well trade Bautista now.\nBoston Red Sox: BUY\nI was originally in the “Sell” camp here, but I’ve changed my mind. Boston currently sits in the final wild card spot, and I just don’t see any teams waiting in the wings to take it away from them. If they were to sell, closer Aroldis Chapman would fetch a pretty penny. Jarren Duran could be moved as the odd man out in a loaded outfield. I cannot, in good conscience, tell a team in a playoff position to offload assets. However, the Sox should be careful. Few teams have a future as bright as they do, with top prospects Roman Anthony, Kristian Campbell, and Marcelo Mayer poised to terrorize the AL East for at least the next five years. I don’t believe that Boston is good enough to win a championship right now, but it’s likely that they will be in two years. Craig Breslow and Co. have no reason to try and accelerate Boston’s timeline at the risk of jeopardizing the future. Go get a rental first baseman and some pitching help, but now is not the time for a big swing.\nChicago Cubs: BUY\nThere might never be a better time for the Cubs to go all in. Superstar Kyle Tucker is a free agent after the season and will earn a massive contract. Chicago would still be a good team without him, but right now they’re downright scary. To be a complete team, the Cubbies need better pitching. Ryan Pressly lost his grip on the closer’s role and the rotation has been beat up with injuries. Starters Seth Lugo and Merrill Kelly are possibilities as rentals, and Sandy Alcantara and Edward Cabrera are more long-term options.\nChicago White Sox: SELL\nNo player is untouchable on these White Sox. Any player who has entered the arbitration phase of his contract should be a trade candidate. Luis Robert Jr. is the most interesting trade piece due to his athleticism, but his batting average has hovered around the Mendoza line all season. The return would be lower than Chicago would like, but it would be worth it to at least get something.\nCincinnati Reds: SELL\nReds fans won’t like this, but Cincinnati is not good enough to win a World Series. FanGraphs gives them an 11.1% chance of playing October baseball, and that’s not enough to compromise a ripe farm system. Nick Martinez and Emilio Pagan are both free agents after the season and could be shipped to a contender. The Reds should focus on 2026, where they should have a great young rotation featuring Hunter Greene, Andrew Abbott, Nick Lodolo, Chase Burns, and Rhett Lowder. Cincy could squeak into the playoffs this year but wouldn’t make enough noise.\nCleveland Guardians: SELL\nCleveland is a .500 ballclub with all but three players under control until 2028. Unlike previous years, they have shown no indication that they could compete in October. They rank in the bottom five in baseball in runs, hits, batting average, OBP, SLG, and OPS. They sport a negative run differential, and their pitching has been average. And yet, they are only three games out of a playoff spot. Carlos Santana’s contract expires after the season, so he could be a trade piece. The Guardians are in that middle ground where they aren’t bad enough to throw in the towel but they aren’t good enough to buy. In those instances, I always lean towards selling. Closer Emmanuel Clase should only be traded for a monumental return.\nColorado Rockies: SELL\nOh, dear. Honestly, it’s hard to imagine any team coveting a Rockies player outside of Brenton Doyle, Hunter Goodman, and Ezequiel Tovar. Maybe a reliever like Jake Bird could make an impact somewhere. Ryan McMahon is in the midst of a rough year, but he could be an option for a team with a hole at the hot corner. Colorado is so far from contention that if they get a deal they like for any player, they should take it. No Rockie is untouchable.\nDetroit Tigers: BUY\nAlthough they’ve struggled as of late, Detroit is a pretty complete team. Tarik Skubal can win them 2 games in a 5-game series at his best. The rest of the rotation is fine, but it wouldn’t hurt to add someone like Alcantara or Zac Gallen. The Tigers would do well to bolster their bullpen, too. David Bednar or Pete Fairbanks would be nice options. Detroit has spent much of the year as the best team in the AL; it’s time for them to use the deadline to reclaim that spot.\nHouston Astros: BUY\nEvery time we have reason to doubt the Astros, they prove us wrong. After losing Alex Bregman and Tucker, it seemed like the franchise might be in a transition period. Instead, Hunter Brown has emerged as an ace alongside Framber Valdez and the offense hasn’t missed a beat. The ‘pen is loaded in Houston, so the Astros should scour the market for a left-handed hitter. Cedric Mullins could be a helpful addition, and McMahon could fill a gap at the hot corner after Isaac Paredes’ injury.\nKansas City Royals: BUY\nAfter a fun postseason run last year, the Royals are three games under .500 and have a 10.8% chance at the playoffs. However, KC has no notable upcoming free agents. The options are to be aggressive sellers and move guys under contract for 2026 or to buy with the future in mind. I’m taking the latter. The Royals don’t have any prospects knocking at the door, so any help next year will come externally. For that reason, why not just make some additions now and see if some magic happens in September? The outfield has been a major issue, I wouldn’t mind seeing the Royals swing a deal for Adolis Garcia or Bryan Reynolds. Both are buy-low candidates but have enjoyed success before.\nLos Angeles Angels: SELL\nThe Angels seem incapable of rebuilding properly. Here’s their chance. They have a host of expiring contracts, Tyler Anderson, Kenley Jansen, and Luis Rengifo among them. All could fetch a modest return. It would be the most “Angels” thing ever to win five or six in a row, start buying, and then rush prospects to the big leagues in hopes of a postseason run. Please, please just concede this season.\nLos Angeles Dodgers: BUY\nLA has been hit hard by injuries and hasn’t been the juggernaut many expected. The bullpen is the biggest weak spot, especially after an injury to closer Tanner Scott. Without too much pitching help coming from the minors, expect the Dodgers to be in on all the big names in the bullpen this week. If the Athletics are listening on Mason Miller, the Dodgers could be a nice fit.\nMiami Marlins: SELL\nLike Colorado, Miami is far enough from contention that most players should be on the table. But unlike the Rockies, the Fish have some pieces. Sandy Alcantara might be the most coveted starter available thanks to his contract and his Cy Young pedigree. Righty Edward Cabrera has also generated some buzz, but he is under team control until 2029. Miami should move Alcantara but hold on to Cabrera barring a ridiculous offer. Outfielder Jesus Sanchez should be traded as well. Houston or Kansas City could be good spots.\nMilwaukee Brewers: BUY\nMilwaukee has been on fire recently, rattling off ten consecutive wins to take control of the NL Central. The starting rotation and bullpen have been quietly excellent, but an additional relief arm wouldn’t hurt. The bigger issue lies at shortstop, where Joey Ortiz has struggled to fill Willy Adames’ shoes. The deadline options in the middle infield are pretty light, but the Twins’ Willi Castro and the Pirates’ Isiah Kiner-Falefa are possibilities. Milwaukee could also seek a reunion with Colorado’s Orlando Arcia.\nMinnesota Twins: SELL\nThe Twins are pretty much in the same position as the Royals, with one major difference: they have significant upcoming free agents to sell. The aforementioned Castro could fill a hole on any contender due to his versatility, and catcher Christian Vazquez is a two-time champion behind the dish. Southpaw Danny Coulombe has been excellent in the bullpen and should be moved. Minnesota’s bigger fish, Jhoan Duran and Joe Ryan, are under contract for at least two more years. I see no reason to trade them and risk being noncompetitive in those seasons.\nNew York Mets: BUY\nThe Mets’ starting rotation has been hit hard by injuries, so restoring it needs to be priorities one, two, and three. David Stearns and the front office could turn to familiar faces to fill those gaps. Lugo and Severino are both former Mets and could play a role in another deep postseason run. The other starting pitching options like Kelly and Gallen would also make sense.\nNew York Yankees: BUY\nIt seems like everything is falling apart in the Bronx, but the Yankees are still given a 89.2% chance of making the postseason. They have a gaping hole at 3rd base, and the Diamondbacks’ Suarez could be the best player available at the deadline. Some worry that Suarez has too much swing-and-miss in his game for a Yankees team that strikes out a lot, but the prospects of Suarez’s power in Yankee Stadium is tantalizing. Other options at third base are McMahon, St. Louis’ Nolan Arenado, and Pittsburgh’s Ke’Bryan Hayes. New York also needs a starting pitcher. It will be interesting to see how aggressive GM Brian Cashman is.\nPhiladelphia Phillies: BUY\nThe Phillies are incredibly top-heavy. Stars Trea Turner, Kyle Schwarber, and Bryce Harper have carried the load offensively while the rest of the offense has struggled. Same goes for the pitching, where the brilliance of a dominant rotation has hidden some issues in a terrible bullpen. The Phils are in the market for a right-handed hitting outfielder and relief help. Orioles outfielder Ramon Laureano could be an option, and Philadelphia has been connected to all the big-name closers. GM “Dealin’ Dave” Dombrowski should hold on to top prospects Andrew Painter and Aidan Miller but should not hesitate to move starter Mick Abel for the right price.\nPittsburgh Pirates: SELL\nAnother disappointing year in Pittsburgh means it’s time to sell again. First, let’s make this clear: Paul Skenes is going nowhere. There are some pieces with potential, though. Andrew Heaney could be a good option for a playoff push, and Kiner-Falefa might just be the best shortstop available. The Bucs would do well to capitalize on closer David Bednar’s resurgence. He’s been fantastic since returning from Triple A, but who knows when he’ll revert back to the performance that earned him a demotion in the first place.\nSan Diego Padres: BUY\nLeft field and catcher are the biggest areas of need for a Padres team that has failed to get over the hump in October. San Diego could try swinging a big trade for Jarren Duran, but I think a smaller trade for Mike Tauchman of the White Sox or Taylor Ward of the Angels might make more sense. Bringing on the leadership and defense of Vazquez behind the plate could help this team win when it matters.\nSan Francisco Giants: BUY\nSan Fran made the biggest splash of the season already, trading for disgruntled Boston star Rafael Devers. They are working him in at first base, which is one of their most sizable holes. Now, it’s time to fix the starting rotation. Logan Webb and Robbie Ray have been great, but Hayden Birdsong was demoted and Justin Verlander just won his first game all year. Giants fans would appreciate the addition of a starter like Lugo or Gallen. With Devers hopefully vacating the DH spot, acquiring Ozuna or O’Hearn could make sense.\nSeattle Mariners: BUY\nPer usual, Seattle’s starting pitching has excelled, but the offense could be better. There’s a huge hole at first base, and the team needs to do more to support Cal Raleigh. I’d love to see Suarez return to Seattle to add more pop to that lineup. Rookie Ben Williamson has played a nice third base, but he doesn’t offer the offensive upside that Suarez brings.\nNote: While I was writing this, Seattle acquired 1B Naylor from Arizona for two prospects. Great move for them.\nSt. Louis Cardinals: SELL\nAgain, I hate telling a team over .500 to sell, but the Cardinals have to do it. Closer Ryan Helsley is the reason why. He’s a free agent after the season and could be the best arm moved at the deadline. Veteran starters Erick Fedde and Miles Mikolas could be dealt as well. If St. Louis can find a trade partner for the aging Nolan Arenado, they should jump at that chance, too.\nTampa Bay Rays: BUY\nWith a 29.6% chance of playing in October, it might seem ambitious for Tampa Bay to buy. But with only one pending free agent, the Rays can run back a similar team next year and compete. They’ve had some tough injury luck this year with Shane McClanahan and Ha-Seong Kim. Buying with an eye towards 2026 would be in their best interest. If the White Sox were willing to eat some money, I could see the Rays having success buying low on Robert Jr.\nTexas Rangers: BUY\nThis could really go either way. Texas is only a game and a half out of a wild card spot, and they have a better chance to make the postseason than Tampa Bay. But they are an older team with more obvious trade candidates. There might be no better time to move on from Jacob deGrom, who once again looks like an ace. But since the Rangers don’t stand to lose any significant free agents this offseason, I would once again buy with an eye towards the future. If things break right for Texas, they could sneak into the playoffs and make some noise. Remember, this team is only two years removed from winnning the World Series.\nToronto Blue Jays: BUY\nThe Jays have defied all expectations and sit in first place in the AL East. Their Pythagorean record (based on run differential) is a little less optimistic, so Toronto has work to do at the deadline. Like most teams, they will be eyeing pitching as August 1 approaches. An additional outfielder like Adolis Garcia might also make sense to add extra thump to the lineup.\nWashington Nationals: SELL\nThis hasn’t been the season that Washington has hoped for. GM Mike Rizzo and manager Dave Martinez were both cut loose after failing to unlock a young roster that has legitimate talent. It feels like we see this every year, but Kyle Finnegan and Josh Bell should be dealt without question. Perhaps Michael Soroka is traded as well as he attempts to bounce back from a litany of injuries. The last two months for the Nats should be all about the young guys. Prospects Robert Hassell III and Brady House should be given plenty of playing time.\nAll playoff probabilities via FanGraphs."

    "title": "2025 NBA Mock Draft",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2025 NBA Draft is upon us, and executives around the league have already kicked into high gear. Impact players like Desmond Bane, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis have already been traded, and the wheeling and dealing is certain to continue throughout the draft, which now spans two days. This year’s draft features a generational prospect, loaded rosters with unusually high selections, and a team with five (5!) first-round choices. Let’s take a look at how the first round might play out.\n1. Dallas Mavericks: F Cooper Flagg, Duke\n2. San Antonio Spurs: G Dylan Harper, Rutgers\n3. Philadelphia 76ers: G VJ Edgecombe, Baylor\n4. Charlotte Hornets: F Ace Bailey, Rutgers\n5. Utah Jazz: G Tre Johnson, Texas\nFlagg and Harper seem like locks to go 1 and 2, but it gets interesting when the 76ers pick. Ace Bailey, probably presumed to go third based on sheer talent, hasn’t worked out for any teams and actually canceled his workout for Philadelphia. His tumultuous pre-draft process clashes with Edgecombe’s, as teams love the Baylor guard’s motor and makeup. The Sixers, who have had their share of first-round flameouts (see Simmons, Ben or Fultz, Markelle), take the safe route and opt for the bouncy Bahamian. Charlotte snaps up Bailey with the fourth pick, as he will have an opportunity to contribute immediately alongside LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller. Johnson has the potential to develop into an elite scorer. He averaged 19.9 points per game as a freshamn in the SEC and pairs a 6’5’’ frame with a 40% 3-point percentage.\n6. Washington Wizards: G Jeremiah Fears, Oklahoma\n7. New Orleans Pelicans: C Khaman Maluach, Duke\n8. Brooklyn Nets: G Kon Knueppel, Duke\n9. Toronto Raptors: G Kasparas Jakucionis, Illinois\n10. Phoenix Suns: C Derik Queen, Maryland\nWith Maluach and Knueppel going 7th and 8th, the lottery is heavy on Blue Devils. Both are safer picks who flourished in their roles at Duke but likely won’t grow into superstars like the top picks could. Fears is on the smaller side (6’2’’), but he is dynamic with the ball in his hands and displayed a knack for clutch buckets at Oklahoma. While they play different positions, Jakucionis and Queen are deft facilitators and would be welcome additions for teams at the back end of the lottery.\n11. Portland Trail Blazers: F Noa Essengue, Ratiopharm Ulm\n12. Chicago Bulls: F Collin Murray-Boyles, South Carolina\n13. Atlanta Hawks: F Carter Bryant, Arizona\n14. San Antonio Spurs: G Egor Demin, BYU\n15. Oklahoma City Thunder: C Joan Beringer, KK Cedevita Olimpija\nOutside of Murray-Boyles, these picks are projects. All are either 18 or 19 years old, and none averaged over 11 points last season. Demin is a supersized 6’8’’ PG, but he only knocked down 27.3% of his threes at BYU. Essengue also struggled from beyond the arc, but he brings size and defense to Portland. Bryant only averaged 6.5 points per game with the Wildcats, though the Hawks may see him as a DeAndre Hunter facsimile. The NBA champs are loaded and have no real weaknesses, so they take a flier on the ultimate project in Beringer. The Frenchman averaged less than 6 PPG in Slovenia. His 7-foot frame comes with remarkable upside.\n16. Memphis Grizzlies: F Cedric Coward, Washington St.\n17. Minnesota Timberwwolves: F Asa Newell, Georgia\n18. Washington Wizards: C Thomas Sorber, Georgetown\n19. Brooklyn Nets: C Danny Wolf, Michigan\n20. Miami Heat: G Walter Clayton Jr, Florida\nYou might remember Clayton from the NCAA Tournament, as his unconscious shooting led the Gators to a National Championship. His age is working against him, but Clayton has the tools to help a team win right away. Wolf was another fixture in March who pairs the body of a center with the playmaking ability of a guard. In a season hindered by injury, Sorber averaged 14.5 PPG and 8.5 RPG as a Hoya. He and Fears would be solid building blocks for a Wizards team that has been treading water for too long.\n21. Utah Jazz: F Hugo Gonzalez, Real Madrid\n22. Brooklyn Nets: G Nolan Traore, Saint-Quentin\n23. New Orleans Pelicans: F Liam NcNeeley, Uconn\n24. Oklahoma City Thunder: F Noah Penda, Le Mans Sarthe\n25. Orlando Magic: F Rasheer Fleming, St. Joseph’s\nThe Thunder double down on Frenchmen and take Penda at pick 24. It wouldn’t be surprising to see GM Sam Presti move this pick for future assets. Gonzalez and Traore are both 19 years of age and will need time to develop. Utah and Brooklyn are years away from making noise and can give them plenty of playing time. McNeeley, who was teammates with Flagg, Queen, and Newell in high school, can do everything well but lacks a calling card.\n26. Brooklyn Nets: F Will Riley, Illinois\n27. Brooklyn Nets: F Drake Powell, North Carolina\n28. Boston Celtics: G Nique Clifford, Colorado St.\n29. Phoenix Suns: C Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton\n30. Los Angeles Clippers: F Johni Broome, Auburn\nIf it seems like you’ve been seeing a lot of Nets mentions, it’s because you have. Brooklyn has a staggering five first-round picks, and it would be shocking if none were dealt. The last picks of the round don’t lack for experience. Clifford, Kalkbrenner, and Broome are all 23 and could join an NBA rotation from the get-go. With the injury to Jayson Tatum and trades of Holiday and Porzingis, Boston is in a bridge year and may ask for immediate contributions from Clifford. The Suns are preparing for life without Kevin Durant and currently roster a guard-heavy team. Kalkbrenner provides a serious lob threat and stifling rim protector."

    "title": "2025 NFL Fantasy Football Rankings",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I love fantasy football. I can remember my first year playing with my friends, when we all drafted quarterbacks first and half the league was controlled by overqualified dads (we were third graders). Since then, the seasons have been filled with highs and lows. I love reminding my friends how I hit on Patrick Mahomes during his breakout year, and they’re always quick to fire back with the year I guaranteed a Kelvin Benjamin breakout. But no matter the year or my success in the previous season, I always construct my own rankings. I do my fair share of research, but they’re essentially from scratch. I jot them down in a little black notebook that has become a mainstay in the draft room. I may not be the greatest fantasy manager, but I like to think I’ve learned enough through the years to make my opinion worth something. Regardless or whether you agree or not, here are my rankings for the 2025 season.\nCreated with non-PPR leagues in mind.\nQB\n\nJosh Allen, BUF\nJalen Hurts, PHI\nLamar Jackson, BAL\nJayden Daniels, WAS\nJoe Burrow, CIN\nBaker Mayfield, TB\nC.J. Stroud, HOU\nPatrick Mahomes, KC\nJustin Fields, NYJ\nCaleb Williams, CHI\nKyler Murray, ARI\nJordan Love, GB\nDak Prescott, DAL\nBo Nix, DEN\nDrake Maye, NE\nTrevor Lawrence, JAX\nJustin Herbert, LAC\nMichael Penix Jr, ATL\nBrock Purdy, SF\nJ.J. McCarthy, MIN\n\nUndervalued: C.J. Stroud\nThe fantasy community has really soured on Stroud after a down sophomore campaign. He often tried to do too much last year, and that led to a dismal 12 interceptions. But his rookie season was phenomenal, and Houston bolstered its receiving core in the draft. Look for Stroud to bounce back in a big way under new OC Nick Caley. You won’t need to take Stroud this high to land him in drafts.\nOvervalued: Brock Purdy\nPurdy could definitely be a servicable starter this year for your fantasy team. That said, the weapons have gotten much worse in San Fran. Deebo Samuel is gone, and Brandon Aiyuk will miss the start of the season with an ACL injury. Jauan Jennings is also dinged up, leaving Ricky Pearsall and George Kittle as the only healthy options. If Christian McCaffrey is at full strength, the offense will run through him, not Purdy. Pass on Purdy and take a shot on someone with higher upside.\nRB\n\nSaquon Barkley, PHI\nBijan Robinson, ATL\nJahmyr Gibbs, DET\nChristian McCaffrey, SF\nAshton Jeanty, LV\nDerrick Henry, BAL\nJonathan Taylor, IND\nDe’Von Achane, MIA\nJosh Jacobs, GB\nChase Brown, CIN\nKenneth Walker, SEA\nBucky Irving, TB\nKyren Williams, LAR\nJames Cook, BUF\nOmarion Hampton, LAC\nJames Conner, ARI\nIsiah Pacheco, KC\nBreece Hall, NYJ\nTony Pollard, TEN\nTreVeyon Henderson, NE\nChuba Hubbard, CAR\nAlvin Kamara, NO\nAaron Jones, MIN\nDavid Montgomery, DET\nJ.K. Dobbins, DEN\nD’Andre Swift, CHI\nTyrone Tracy, NYG\nJaylen Warren, PIT\nTank Bigsby, JAX\nR.J. Harvey, DEN\nKaleb Johnson, PIT\nJordan Mason, MIN\nJoe Mixon, HOU\nJacory Croskey-Merritt, WAS\nQuinshon Judkins, CLE\nZach Charbonnet, SEA\nTravis Etienne, JAX\nJavonte Williams, DAL\nNick Chubb, HOU\nJaydon Blue, DAL\nAustin Ekeler, WAS\nBraelon Allen, NYJ\nRhamondre Stevenson, NE\nBhayshul Tuten, JAX\nBrian Robinson, SF\nTyjae Spears, TEN\nTrey Benson, ARI\nRay Davis, BUF\nJerome Ford, CLE\nRico Dowdle, CAR\n\nUndervalued: Isiah Pacheco\nLike Stroud, we seem to have forgotten about Pacheco at his best. He is fully healthy and has little competition in the backfield. More importantly, he is tied to the Kansas City Chiefs offense. There will be lots of scoring and even more positive game scripts. Pacheco could be a steal for your fantasy team this year.\nOvervalued: David Montgomery\nI don’t feel super strongly about this one, but just buy Montgomery with caution. Jahmyr Gibbs is only getting better, and Monty could soon be relegated to the No. 2 instead of the 1A. Former OC Ben Johnson is in Chicago, and the Lions will be hard-pressed to score as much as they did last season. If you believe in Gibbs, don’t waste a pick on Montgomery.\nWR\n\nJa’Marr Chase, CIN\nCeeDee Lamb, DAL\nJustin Jefferson, MIN\nMalik Nabers, NYG\nNico Collins, HOU\nAmon-Ra St. Brown, DET\nBrian Thomas Jr, JAX\nPuka Nacua, LAR\nDrake London, ATL\nJaxon Smith-Njigba, SEA\nA.J. Brown, PHI\nMarvin Harrison Jr, ARI\nLadd McConkey, LAC\nTyreek Hill, MIA\nTee Higgins, CIN\nMike Evans, TB\nTerry McLaurin, WAS\nGarrett Wilson, NYJ\nTetairoa McMillan, CAR\nD.K. Metcalf, PIT\nDavante Adams, LAR\nD.J. Moore, CHI\nGeorge Pickens, DAL\nDevonta Smith, PHI\nZay Flowers, BAL\nXavier Worthy, KC\nRashee Rice, KC\nJaylen Waddle, MIA\nJordan Addison, MIN\nCourtland Sutton, DEN\nEmeka Egbuka, TB\nTravis Hunter, JAX\nJameson Williams, DET\nCalvin Ridley, TEN\nJayden Reed, GB\nChris Olave, NO\nDeebo Samuel, WAS\nRome Odunze, CHI\nRicky Pearsall, SF\nStefon Diggs, NE\nJakobi Meyers, LV\nMatthew Golden, GB\nChristian Kirk, HOU\nJosh Downs, IND\nJauan Jennings, SF\nCooper Kupp, SEA\nJerry Jeudy, CLE\nKeon Coleman, BUF\nMichael Pittman Jr, IND\nRashod Bateman, BAL\n\nUndervalued: Marvin Harrison, Jr.\nHis rookie season wasn’t bad, but it’s safe to say Harrison was a disappointment in fantasy last year. The fact that his 2024 Draft classmates overshadowed him might allow you to nab MHJ at a discount this year. He and TE Trey McBride are the two true receiving weapons in Arizona, so targets won’t be an issue. Expect Harrison to deliver on the hype that surrounded him coming out of Ohio State.\nOvervalued: Puka Nacua\nNacua is a great receiver, and this dubious distinction has nothing to do with him. Rams QB Matthew Stafford has been fighting through back problems all offseason. If Stafford misses time, Nacua’s season could be derailed. I don’t want to draft someone whose success hinges on the health of a 37-year old signal caller who has taken his share of hits throughout the years.\nTE\n\nBrock Bowers, LV\nTrey McBride, ARI\nGeorge Kittle, SF\nSam LaPorta, DET\nT.J. Hockenson, MIN\nTravis Kelce, KC\nMark Andrews, BAL\nEvan Engram, DEN\nKyle Pitts, ATL\nTucker Kraft, GB\nTyler Warren, IND\nDalton Kincaid, BUF\nDavid Njoku, CLE\nJonnu Smith, PIT\nJake Ferguson, DAL\nHunter Henry, NE\nDallas Goedert, PHI\nColston Loveland, CHI\nBrenton Strange, JAX\nZach Ertz, WAS\n\nUndervalued: Tyler Warren\nCould Warren be the next rookie tight end to break out? I think so. Warren was dynamic at Penn State, and Indianapolis should do whatever it can to get the ball into his hands. An uncertain QB situation might actually help Warren reel in additional checkdown targets. Gambling on a rookie TE can be risky, but Warren combines talent with opportunity in Indy.\nOvervalued: David Njoku\nNjoku has proven to be a valuable fantasy asset, but don’t pay up for him this year. Cleveland is going to be abysmal, and I don’t want any part of that offense on my fantasy team. The best-case scenario for the veteran might be a midseason trade. Go invest in a tight end with more upside."
